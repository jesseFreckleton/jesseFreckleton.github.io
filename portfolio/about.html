            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Since a very young age I’ve shown a passion for technology and known I’ve wanted to work in a field involving some type of tech. As a young kid I remember pouring over the Scholastic News articles about new inventions such as robots and trying to soak up all the information. When I was in junior high my family got a computer for us kids, I would spend hours on there. Looking at all the different options in the computer and wanting to figure out how it all worked. That passion continued to grow as I became an adult and started spending my free time teaching myself to code. While teaching myself to code I worked as a manager at Wendy’s which taught me many things including leadership and solving problem skills.</p>
                <p>More recently however, I’ve been given the opportunity to start studying at <i>College of Western Idaho (CWI)</i> to get my <em>Associates Degree in Software Development</em>. In my <strong>first semester,</strong> as a student, I completed all the generals required by <i>CWI</i> in order to start the courses for my degree. Currently I’m about to finish my <i>first semester as a software development student.</i> During this time, I have learned how to become a better problem solver as well as how to start developing my professional persona.</p>
