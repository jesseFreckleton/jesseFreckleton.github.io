    What I've Done:
    -Created html and css files for every page on the navigation bar.
    -Created javaScript files for home page(app.js) and contact page.

    -index.html is the home page.
    -about.html is the about me page.
    -contact.html contains the contact form.
    -experience.html contains the newsletter sign up.
    -confirm.html was created to let the user know their form was sent/submitted successfully.
        -confirm.html is not in the navigation bar and can only be accessed by submitting the contact form.

    What javascript is included:
    -The app.js file includes the menu implementation.
    -The contact.html page includes javascript in its form, which also includes validation.
