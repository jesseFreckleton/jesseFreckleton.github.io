            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>My first job was at the age of 15 as a <b>waitress</b> for wedding receptions. Since then, I have worked various jobs which have all taught me to be a hard worker who focuses until the task is completed. However, more recently in my work experience I was a <strong>for Wendy’s, which lasted for six years.</strong> Working as a manager taught me great leadership skills as well as how to problem solve effectively. While in college I have been working from home as a <strong>customer service agent,</strong> which has given me the flexibility needed to study at <i>CWI</i>. With this job I am grateful that I’m continuously learning new ways to connect with customers.</p>
