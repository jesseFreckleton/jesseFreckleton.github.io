Created Wednesday - April 19th, 2023 for Project 01 in Client Side Frameworks at College of Western Idaho.
 
 Project Specifications:
 In this assignment, you will build a Parallax Bootstrap site from scratch.
 The site can be based on anything bust must have at least 5 sections. You may use templates from W3Schools,
 but you may NOT use a premade theme, theme builder, or Bootstrap builder.
 
 What to do:
 1. Create a parallax Bootstrap site.
 2. Add at least 5 sections.
 3. Fill with placeholder content.
 4. Ensure everything is built from scratch.
 5. May use CSS and JS Libraries.

 What I've done:
 
 Created index.html, style.css, and images folder.
 Used a bootstrap starter template to get started on my website. Then I added 5 sections with div containers.
 These sections are as follows: Welcome, articles, about, contact, and feedback/suggestions. Also added social links 
 at the bottom as the footer.
 Added one for Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
 Added navigation to the top of the page and made it's position static. Also added links to the navigation to make it easier
 to jump around the page sections.
 Set up styling in the css file to create a parallax/dynamic feel in my backgrounds.
 Also added styling for the rest of the page elements such as the text color and alignment. I also added some of
 the bootstrap styling. Including changing the color of primary-color to match the website theme better.
 Added form validation with bootstrap. Which then led me to add suggestions.html as a confirmation page for the user.
 There is a link to home on that page as well to bring them back to the main parallax website.
